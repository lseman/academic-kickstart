Laio O. Seman received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Federal University of Santa Catarina in 2017. He has previously worked as a University Professor at the Federal University of Technology - Paran\'a (UTFPR), Brazil. He is currently a professor in Graduate Program of Applied Computer Sciences, in the Itajai Valley University (UNIVALI), focusing on strategies for static and dynamic optimization, along with applications in traffic control, cyberphysical systems, and oil and gas production systems.

Also, he has been co-advising theses and dissertations in the area of optimization, including decomposition strategies such as Benders, Lagrange and Dantzig-Wolfe. His research interests focus on the optimization of large scale systems and FPGA applications.
