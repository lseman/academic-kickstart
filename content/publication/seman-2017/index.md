abstract: "Current concepts used in engineering training take into account not only teaching traditional math and physics, but also critical thinking, engagement with society, and ecological awareness. This work proposes the application of Project-Based Learning (PBL) as a way to include renewable energies subjects in the classroom. The methodology was employed in 37 students of a one semester course of the Electrical Engineering major of the Blumenau Regional University, Brazil. To assist in the process, a web application entitled MPPTjs was developed, aiming to facilitate the understanding of the students about photovoltaic (PV) panels and maximum power points tracking (MPPT). Finally, a questionnaire was applied to assess the impact of the project."
