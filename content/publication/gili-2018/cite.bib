 abstract = {This paper discusses the study of the indirect space vector modulation applied to the matrix multimodular converter (MMMC), a converter which connects the theory of matrix converters with the concepts of multilevel topologies, allowing the use of low voltage semiconductors in high power application due to voltage stress sharing between modules. During the theoretical studies and simulations, two topological variations of MMMC are compared, testing in each one two different switching sequences for the same modulation in order to measure the influence of the switching order in the total harmonic distortion of the converter. For the tests were simulated converters of 333 kVa and 1 MVA, using 4.16 kV as the line voltage input of the transformers, switched at 1.8 kHz. After the performed tests, one of the switching sequences showed a lower total harmonic distortion in the two converters studied, due to its characteristic of not inverting the times of vectors applications depending on the phase voltage, generating a potentially more symmetrical waveform.},
