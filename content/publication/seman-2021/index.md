abstract: 'The daily optimization of oil production systems relies on models to simulate
  phenomena of interest, such as fluid flow in wells and risers. Keeping models up
  to date is no easy task, due to the complex nature of the processes, and the need
  of human intervention to tune simulators. This work contributes by taking advantage
  of real-time measurements, to adjust process parameters that play a key role in
  steady-state simulators, e.g. the basic sediment and water and gas-oil ratio, and
  thereby optimize production for the prevailing conditions. The methodology consists
  of: (i) a strategy to identify steady-state of process variables (i.e., flows and
  pressures); (ii) an optimization formulation to adjust the key parameters such that
  the predicted total flows from the wells match the measured platform streams, while
  honoring pressure and flow measurements at critical points.'
