abstract: 'Developing star trackers quickly is non-trivial. Achieving reproducible
  results and comparing different algorithms are also open problems. In this sense,
  this work proposes the use of synthetic star images (a simulated sky), allied with
  the standardized structure of the Universal Verification Methodology as the base
  of a design approach. The aim is to organize the project, speed up the development
  time by providing a standard verification methodology. Future rework is reduced
  through two methods: a verification platform that us shared under a free software
  licence; and the layout of Universal Verification Methodology enforces reusability
  of code through an object-oriented approach. We propose a black-box structure for
  the verification platform with standard interfaces, and provide examples showing
  how this approach can be applied to the development of a star tracker for small
  satellites, targeting a system-on-a-chip design. The same test benches were applied
  to both early conceptual software-only implementations, and later optimized software-hardware
  hybrid systems, in a hardware-in-the-loop configuration. This test bench reuse strategy
  was interesting also to show the regression test capability of the developed platform.
  Furthermore, the simulator was used to inject specific noise, in order to evaluate
  the system under some real-world conditions.'
