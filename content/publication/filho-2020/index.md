abstract: During satellite development, engineers need to simulate and understand
  the satellite's behavior in orbit and minimize failures or inadequate satellite
  operation. In this sense, one crucial assessment is the irradiance field, which
  impacts, for example, the power generation through the photovoltaic cells, as well
  as rules the satellite's thermal conditions. This good practice is also valid for
  CubeSat projects. This paper presents a numerical tool to explore typical irradiation
  scenarios for CubeSat missions by combining state-of-the-art models. Such a tool
  can provide the input estimation for software and hardware in the loop analysis
  for a given initial condition and predict it along with the satellite's lifespan.
  Three main models will be considered to estimate the irradiation flux over a CubeSat,
  namely an orbit, an attitude, and a radiation source model, including solar, albedo,
  and infrared emitted by the Earth. A case study illustrating the tool's abilities
  is presented for a typical CubeSats' two-line element set (TLE) and five attitudes.
  Finally, a possible application of the tool as an input to a CubeSat task-scheduling
  is introduced. The results show that the complete model's use has considerable differences
  from the simplified models sometimes used in the literature.
