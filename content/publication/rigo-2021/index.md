abstract: The value and overall efficacy of a satellite mission are directly affected
  by its task scheduling strategy and the associated amount of work performed in orbit.
  Despite subject to many constraints, task scheduling is ultimately restricted by
  the amount of power available at any given moment. In this paper, we propose a mathematical
  integer programming (IP) formulation designed to maximize the number of tasks to
  be executed by a satellite, constrained to the amount of power available at any
  moment along the course of an orbit. The optimization model is formulated to contemplate
  task priority, minimum and maximum number of task activation, minimum and maximum
  execution time, minimum and maximum period of a given task and execution window.
  The variant power input vector was calculated based on the solar cells efficiency,
  and also on an analytical model used to estimate the irradiance field according
  to parameters of orbit and attitude. To demonstrate the applicability of our methodology,
  we conduct several experiments considering three satellite sizes with different
  orbits and task parameters. The results show that the proposed offline scheduling
  algorithm generates an optimal energy effective scheduling plan, allowing the best
  possible use of available energy resources while ensuring the quality of service
  (QoS).
