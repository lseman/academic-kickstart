abstract: This paper presents two decomposition approaches, Bilevel Optimization and
  Benders Decomposition, to a model predictive control of resource-constrained dynamic
  systems. The proposed methods yield a distributed solution that converges to the
  same optimum that would be obtained by a centralized controller. In this context,
  it is shown that the decompositions enable the use of multi-core or distributed
  architectures. A level regularization method is applied to accelerate the convergence
  of the Benders decomposition. Computational analyses from experiments with synthetic
  problems and a problem regarding the charging of vehicle batteries are reported
  and discussed, which showed that the decomposition approaches are effective at solving
  the distributed problems, achieving a global optimum.
