 abstract = {With the advent of web programming languages the so called web applications are emerging, applications that run directly from your browser, without installing additional plug-ins. A major advantage of web applications is the fact that they are multiplatform, offering the possibility of running on smartphones and tablets, technologies that are more and more present in day-to-day lives. And due to the constantly expanding of the power electronics theme, largely due to increased use of switching power supplies in electronic products today, a web application to connect web applications and power electronics was developed. An application that calculates parameters of Buck converters and plots information relevant to it to the user in a simple and easy way.},
