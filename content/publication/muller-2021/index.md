abstract: Research on short-term steady-sate production optimization of oilfields
  led to the development of models and solution methods, several of which have found
  their way into practice. Early models considered satellite wells that operate with
  a fixed topside pressure and gas-lift injection, while recent approaches address
  distinct types of artificial lifting, pressure control, and processing equipment.
  By integrating existing approaches, this work presents a flexible model for production
  optimization that considers new features, including flow assurance constraints and
  smart selection of artificial lifting operating modes (gas-lift with multiple valves,
  electrical submersible pumping, and dual completion). Given that the proposed model
  is conceptual, piecewise-linear functions are obtained from field and simulation
  process data to approximate nonlinear relations. This way, the methodology decides
  the best combinations of routing and operation modes to maximize production gains.
  Simulated results are reported considering a representative asset that illustrates
  complex behavior.
