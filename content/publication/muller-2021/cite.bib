 abstract = {Research on short-term steady-sate production optimization of oilfields led to the development of models and solution methods, several of which have found their way into practice. Early models considered satellite wells that operate with a fixed topside pressure and gas-lift injection, while recent approaches address distinct types of artificial lifting, pressure control, and processing equipment. By integrating existing approaches, this work presents a flexible model for production optimization that considers new features, including flow assurance constraints and smart selection of artificial lifting operating modes (gas-lift with multiple valves, electrical submersible pumping, and dual completion). Given that the proposed model is conceptual, piecewise-linear functions are obtained from field and simulation process data to approximate nonlinear relations. This way, the methodology decides the best combinations of routing and operation modes to maximize production gains. Simulated results are reported considering a representative asset that illustrates complex behavior.},
