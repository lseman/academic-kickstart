abstract: This paper presents the embedded systems along with the first in-orbit results
  of FloripaSat-I, a complete CubeSat mission developed at the Federal University
  of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The satellite's service module has three main subsystems,
  each with an embedded processor and its peripherals. This paper presents an overview
  of the nanosatellite architecture designed for the mission, including the embedded
  systems, functionalities, and components. Launched in December 2019 atop a Chinese
  Long March 4B rocket, FloripaSat-I has been since then transmitting mission data,
  which is a metric used to validate its open-source service platform through flight
  heritage. The results collected in orbit are presented and discussed, as well as
  the student's perception about the challenges in the project. With the analysis
  of the results, it is possible to identify technical points to be improved by external
  groups with interest to reuse the open-source service platform for the next missions,
  and the impact that this teaching–learning methodology has in the students.
