abstract: "The analysis of multiphase flow from wells is periodically performed in test separators, producing data on fluid and reservoir properties such as the gas–oil ratio, water cut, pressure, and temperature measurements from sensors. Such data enables the tuning of multiphase flow simulators to reflect the prevailing conditions of reservoir and production processes. Besides meeting demands from the regulatory agency, a well-adjusted model empowers engineers to plan production and derive representative models for production optimization. This work proposes the use of derivative-free optimization methods for tuning an in-house multiphase flow simulator widely used by Petrobras. The tuning algorithm was coupled to the simulation software to free engineers from lengthy analyses, allowing the timely update of processes that are key in decision making and production optimization."
