abstract: Interruptions in the supply of electricity cause numerous losses to consumers,
  whether residential or industrial and may result in fines being imposed on the regulatory
  agency's concessionaire. In Brazil, the electrical transmission and distribution
  systems cover a large territorial area, and because they are usually outdoors, they
  are exposed to environmental variations. In this context, periodic inspections are
  carried out on the electrical networks, and ultrasound equipment is widely used,
  due to non-destructive analysis characteristics. Ultrasonic inspection allows the
  identification of defective insulators based on the signal interpreted by an operator.
  This task fundamentally depends on the operator's experience in this interpretation.
  In this way, it is intended to test machine learning applications to interpret ultrasound
  signals obtained from electrical grid insulators, distribution, class 25 kV. Currently,
  research in the area uses several models of artificial intelligence for various
  types of evaluation. This paper studies Multilayer Perceptron networks' application
  to the classification of the different conditions of ceramic insulators based on
  a restricted database of ultrasonic signals recorded in the laboratory.
