abstract: "This work presents a statistical analysis of the views of Electrical Engineering students, regarding the knowledge formation process in a Project-Based Learning application, as a complement to classical teaching methods. In order to assess this approach, an active learning methodology developed especially for part-time degree courses, called Project-Based Learning Agile (PBLA), has been proposed and implemented at the Regional University of Blumenau (FURB), Brazil. Through the analysis of questionnaire responses obtained over four consecutive semesters, using partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM), it was possible to understand statistically how the learning process is connected to PBLA. The data analysis suggests that the educational process applied in this work is rooted in a humanist basis, formed by Ego and Cooperation among students. The PBLA approach, sustained by this Humanization, serves as a basis for the Learning. Thus, the results suggest that humanization is an important part in the education process of a new electrical engineer."
