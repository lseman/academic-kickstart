 abstract = {CubeSats have been receiving special attention in recent years, mainly due to their agile development process, and also the low costs involved when compared to traditional satellites. In this context, this paper presents the critical embedded systems designed for FloripaSat-1, which is a complete CubeSat mission developed at UFSC, Brazil. The satellite's service module has three main subsystems, each with an embedded processor and their own hardware architecture. This paper presents a review of the nanosatellite embedded systems designed for the mission, their functionalities, architectures, and components. Experimental results obtained from the engineering model qualification tests are also presented, showing the energy power system and telecommunications capabilities of the mission.},
