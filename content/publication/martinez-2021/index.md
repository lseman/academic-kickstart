abstract: This work presents an integrated thermal-electrical simulation model, capable
  of taking into account the thermal and electrical effects of the battery and photovoltaic
  panels for each instant of time in a given orbit and attitude. Using the physical
  equations that govern the thermal and electrical models involved during a CubeSat
  operation, the proposed integrated model can estimate the temperature and energy
  conditions of the battery, not only in an isolated way but also in considering the
  mutual effects on the system. Besides, special attention is given to photovoltaic
  panels used in the energy harvesting process, whose performance is affected by irradiance
  and temperature along the orbit. The integrated model can be useful for engineers
  when developing the subsystems of their CubeSats, taking into account, for example,
  the battery temperature control through a heater. Simulations were performed to
  illustrate the functioning of the proposed model with variations in the power requirements
  of its modules and the temperature of the battery throughout the orbit, and a heater's
  influence on it.
