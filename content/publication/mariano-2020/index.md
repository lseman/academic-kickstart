abstract: The FloripaSat-I project consists of an initiative from the Federal University
  of Santa Catarina (UFSC), in Brazil, to train students to design, test and integrate
  innovative space systems. The group just developed its first open-source CubeSat,
  the FloripaSat-I, which aims to empower students to develop space systems through
  a practical approach, where they have full control of the design and test of a real
  spacecraft. The project has already gone through all the stages of a CubeSat mission
  prior to the launching and operation stages. A prototype of the satellite, as well
  the engineering models 1 and 2 (EM-I and EM-II) were built. The expertise provided
  by the engineering models allows the development of a functional flight model (FM).
  This paper presents the validation and qualification tests that pass various FloripaSat-I
  models, from the engineering model to the flight model. All stages of the project
  are described, the tests performed in each phase, as well as the lessons learned.
  Thus, this paper serves as a guidance for other university teams that want to test
  their own CubeSats, as well as teams that want to use the open-source hardware and
  software left as heritage by this project.
