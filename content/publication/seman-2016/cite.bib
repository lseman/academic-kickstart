 abstract = {Traditional teaching has evolved little in the last century, with roots in unilateral knowledge transfer where the teacher is responsible for all steps of the teaching-learning process. Existing methodologies try to change this paradigm, supported by the freedom brought by the curricular guidelines. This work proposes the application of Project-Based Learning (PjBL) as an addition to what is already happening in the classroom, trying to identify in the Electrical Engineering Department of Blumenau Regional University the profile of teachers and students. This information is used as a base in order to apply an interdisciplinary project that seeks to develop cognitive ability and the search for answers of the students. The methodology was shaped for a night course where students must conciliate, in most cases, an external full-time job with the college education. Through its application, it was statistically possible to understand how knowledge interacts with the self-esteem and with the self-actualization of the student, forming a cycle of learning which is indirectly strengthened by cooperation (through self-esteem and self-realization). Therefore, it is possible to understand that a motivated student is a student more likely to grasp the knowledge involved in the project, which in turn generates more motivation and makes the cycle reload.},
