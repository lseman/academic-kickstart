 abstract = {Estimating temperature is essential both to design reliable CubeSats and to keep it under maximum operating efficiency. This paper presents the transient thermal simulation of a CubeSat 1U, where the heat transfer by conduction and radiation (external and internal) are solved considering a typical CubeSat mission launched from the International Space Station. The objective is to obtain the temperature field based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM), with inner heat transfer by radiation. The Gebhart method computes the internal heat exchange through successive reflections, and an obstruction model supports the calculation of view factors. Three boundary conditions for the inner side of the CubeSat are tested: without internal heat transfer by radiation, or zero emissivity (ϵ=0.0), with intermediate internal heat transfer by radiation (ϵ=0.5), and maximum internal heat transfer by radiation (ϵ=1.0). The results show a significant impact of the internal heat transfer by radiation in the temperature field of both inner and outer parts of the satellite, and therefore it should not be ignored. Good agreement of transient temperature is found between the FVM and another more straightforward formulation based on the Lumped Method, although the three-dimensional effects are significant and cannot be obtained with such a simplified model.},
