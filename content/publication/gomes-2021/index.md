abstract: The balance between work and personal life is a major challenge for organisational
  leaders nowadays, as it is acknowledged to be a source innovation and competitive
  advantage. Moreover, the literature indicates that transformational leadership,
  and organisational learning favour Work-life balance (WLB), by promoting intellectual
  stimulation, motivation, and self-confidence among members of the organisation.
  Despite the importance of these constructs, and especially in the service innovation
  context, no studies have been found that examine this relationship. Thus, this study
  aims at evaluating the association of transformational leadership and WLB on service
  innovation through organisational learning. Exploratory quantitative research was
  performed using data collected from a sample of 159 Brazilian architecture and urbanism
  Knowledge-Intensive Business Services (KIBS). Data were analysed using Structural
  Equation Modeling. We found positive relationships between transformational leadership,
  WLB/flexibility, organisational learning capability, and service innovation. However,
  no association was found between transformational leadership and organisational
  learning with WLB/Family Life. The theoretical contribution focuses on a framework
  that integrates transformational leadership, WLB, organisational learning, and service
  innovation, providing relevant insights for KIBS. On the practical side, this paper
  points to the importance of underlying organisational values that motivate and promote
  innovative behaviour among employees in the service innovation arena.
