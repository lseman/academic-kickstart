abstract: The problem of optimizing the operation of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lines
  that share a common corridor is analyzed. The goal is to minimize passengers travel
  time, including waiting at stations. In the common corridor, stations are shared
  by several bus lines which present riding alternatives for passengers with origins
  and destinations within the corridor. Since buses from different lines interact
  in the corridor, optimal multi-line headways that consider headways across all lines
  can alter single-line headways so as to maximize user benefit. We develop the system
  model in a mathematical programming fashion, embedded with the control strategy
  as bus holding decision variables. The method, named Multi-line Integrated Holding
  Control Strategy (M-IHCS), implements the required bus headway regulation for multiple
  lines in an integrated and simultaneous manner. Numerical tests of the optimization
  approach developed for the system model show the distinctive features of the solutions,
  indicating the superiority of multi-line headway control over its single-line counterpart.
