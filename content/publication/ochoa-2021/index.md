abstract: Since the early 2000s, life in cities has changed significantly due to the
  Internet of Things (IoT). This concept enables developers to integrate different
  devices collecting, storing, and processing a large amount of data, enabling new
  services to improve various professional and personal activities. However, privacy
  issues arise with a large amount of data generated, and solutions based on blockchain
  technology and smart contract have been developed to address these issues. Nevertheless,
  several issues must still be taken into account when developing blockchain architectures
  aimed at the IoT scenario because security flaws still exist in smart contracts,
  mainly due to the lack of ease when building the code. This article presents a blockchain
  storage architecture focused on license plate recognition (LPR) systems for smart
  cities focusing on privacy, performance, and security. The proposed architecture
  relies on the Ethereum platform. Each smart contract matches the privacy preferences
  of a license plate to be anonymized through public encryption. The storage of data
  captured by the LPR system can only be done if the smart contract enables it. However,
  in the case of motivation foreseen by the legislation, a competent user can change
  the smart contract and enable the storage of the data captured by the LPR system.
  Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed architecture is satisfactory,
  regarding the scalability of the built private network. Furthermore, tests on our
  smart contract using security and structure analysis tools on the developed script
  demonstrate that our solution is fraud-proof. The results obtained in all experiments
  bring evidence that our architecture is feasible to be used in real scenarios.
