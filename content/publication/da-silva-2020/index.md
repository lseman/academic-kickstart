abstract: "Exoskeletons are wearable mobile robots that combine various technologies to enable limb movement with greater strength and endurance, being used in several application areas, such as industry and medicine. In this context, this paper presents the development of a hybrid control method for exoskeletons, combining admission and impedance control based on electromyographic input signals. A proof of concept of a robotic arm with two degrees of freedom, mimicking the functions of a human's upper limb, was built to evaluate the proposed control system. Through tests that measured the discrepancy between the angles of the human joint and the joint of the exoskeleton, it was possible to determine that the system remained within an acceptable error range. The average error is lower than 4.3%, and the robotic arm manages to mimic the movements of the upper limbs of a human in real-time."
